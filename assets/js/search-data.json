            "content": "The Situation . A while back I had a the need to take what were essentially audit logs, where multiple records existed for each id, and flatten then into a single record for each id. . I pulled the data into python from a database as a list of over 100,000 tuples. Here is an example of the data I was looking at. . csv (audit_record.csv) RECORD,ID,OLD_VALUE,FINAL_VALUE,DATE,TABLE,COLUMN 1, id1, value1, value2, 02/01/2020, table1, column1 2, id1, value2, value3, 02/02/2020, table1, column1 3, id1, value3, value1, 02/03/2020, table1, column1 4, id2, value4, value5, 02/01/2020, table1, column1 5, id2, value5, , 02/03/2020, table1, column1 6, id3, value6, value7, 02/01/2020, table1, column1 7, id3, value8, value9, 02/02/2020, table1, column1 8, id4, value10, value11, 02/01/2020, table1, column1 9, id4, value11, value12, 02/02/2020, table1, column1 10,id4, value12, value4, 02/03/2020, table1, column1 . The Problem . This was an audit log for a series of undesired changes. Here is an example of the progression of these changes: . 02/01/2020: a large number of records were changed and iterated to the next highest available number | 02/02/2020: a similar number of records (but not all) were changed again, again iterating to the next available number | 02/03/2020: an additional event took place that resulted in many of the records being corrected (returning to their previous numbers), but some ended at yet another iteration higher, while still others ended up missing a value altogether. | . In the sample information above there are 4 different unintended transformations of data that occurred: . id1: Example series of changes that ended back at the correct value: . csv 02/01: value1 =&gt; value2 | 02/02: value2 =&gt; value3 | 02/03: value3 =&gt; value1 . id2: Example of series of changes that ended with a complete removal of the value: . csv 02/01: value4 =&gt; value5 | 02/02: No Changes | 02/03: value5 =&gt; null . id3: Example of series of changes that ended at a different number: . csv 02/01: value6 =&gt; value7 | 02/02: value7 =&gt; value8 | 02/03: No Changes . id4: Example of series of changes that ended up a different id&#39;s value (data not only incorrect, but conflicting): . csv 02/01: value10 =&gt; value11 | 02/02: value11 =&gt; value12 | 02/03: value12 =&gt; value4 . Details . In addition to the obvious differences between these 4 different changes, there are some that are harder to see: . Some id records went through 3 changes, others went through 2 (this one is not hard to see) | The last change of some id records was on 02/02, while others&#39; last change was on 02/03 | . Altogether, the different factors that need to be understood are the following: . Some records changed each of the 3 days, some only on 2 | Some of the records that only changed 2 times had their final changed on day 2, while others skipped day 2 and had their final change on day 3 | Some records eventually were self corrected to their original value | Some records iterated 2 times and ended at a different number | Some records eventually ended up with a final value of null | Some records ended up at the original value of a different id | . This example, as messy as it is, also is cleaner that the situation itself. The follow challenges existed: . There were some that only had 1 audit record where the original value was immediately replaced with a null | The list of tuples was not sorted in any fashion | The dates were actually spread over a period of 14 or 15 days, with the changes for a single record following anywhere in that time period -- not a clean 3 days like the example here. | . The tuples that represent the audits for these changes are all over the place. In the end, what I wanted to see clearly what I was dealing with. In order to do that I needed to have a list of new records that would clearly show me the following for each id: . original value, and the date that value was lost | final value, and the date that value was added | . The Solution . Gather the change associated with a single id together, identified by that id: | . import csv from collections import defaultdict reader = csv.DictReader(open(&#39;2020-06-08/audit_record.csv&#39;)) dict_by_user = defaultdict(list) for i in reader: dict_by_user[i[&#39;ID&#39;]].append(i) . The results in dcit_by_user are the following data structure (python dictionary) | . dict_by_user = { &#39;id1&#39;: [[&#39;id1&#39;, &#39;value1&#39;, &#39;value2&#39;, &#39;02/01/2020&#39;, &#39;table1&#39;, &#39;column1&#39;], [&#39;id1&#39;, &#39;value2&#39;, &#39;value3&#39;, &#39;02/02/2020&#39;, &#39;table1&#39;, &#39;column1&#39;], [&#39;id1&#39;, &#39;value3&#39;, &#39;value1&#39;, &#39;02/03/2020&#39;, &#39;table1&#39;, &#39;column1&#39;]], &#39;id2&#39;: [[&#39;id2&#39;, &#39;value4&#39;, &#39;value5&#39;, &#39;02/01/2020&#39;, &#39;table1&#39;, &#39;column1&#39;], [&#39;id2&#39;, &#39;value5&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;02/03/2020,&#39; &#39;table1&#39;, &#39;column1&#39;]], &#39;id3&#39;: [[&#39;id3&#39;, &#39;value6&#39;, &#39;value7&#39;, &#39;02/01/2020&#39;, &#39;table1&#39;, &#39;column1&#39;], [&#39;id3&#39;, &#39;value8&#39;, &#39;value9&#39;, &#39;02/02/2020&#39;, &#39;table1&#39;, &#39;column1&#39;]], &#39;id4&#39;: [[&#39;id4&#39;, &#39;value10&#39;,&#39;value11&#39;, &#39;02/01/2020&#39;, &#39;table1&#39;, &#39;column1&#39;], [&#39;id4&#39;, &#39;value11&#39;,&#39;value12&#39;, &#39;02/02/2020&#39;, &#39;table1&#39;, &#39;column1&#39;], [&#39;id4&#39;, &#39;value12&#39;,&#39;value4&#39;, &#39;02/03/2020&#39;, &#39;table1&#39;, &#39;column1&#39;]] } .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
